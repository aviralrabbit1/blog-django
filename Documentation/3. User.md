# Users and Authentication

1. To have unique users and their posts, in `BlogApp/models.py`
    ```py
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User

    class Post(models.Model):
        ...
        # owner field is a foreign key to the Django's built-in User model, 
        # representing the owner of the post.
        owner = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        ...

    ```
2. Create `BlogApp/serializers.py` for serialization and deserialization of data type e.g. `user`
   ```py
    from rest_framework import serializers
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    from .models import *

    ...
            
    class UserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
        class Meta: 
            model = User
            fields = "__all__"
            
    # custom serializer for user registration
    class UserRegSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
        username = serializers.CharField(max_length=200)
        password = serializers.CharField(max_length=100, write_only=True)
        # write-only means the password won't be included in serialized responses.
        
        def create(self, validated_data): # create method overridden to handle user creation
            user = User.objects.create(
                username = validated_data['username'],
                password = validated_data['password']
            )
            # When data is validated and the create method is called, it creates a new User instance 
            # using the provided username and password, and then returns the created user.
            
            return user
        ...   
   ```
