# Models

```py
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# Category model that represents the categories for the posts. 
# This allows to associate posts with different categories.
class Category(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Post(models.Model):
    id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    description = models.TextField()
    image_url = models.URLField()
    date_posted = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    
    # owner field is a foreign key to the Django's built-in User model, 
    # representing the owner of the post.
    owner = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    # The category field is a foreign key to the Category model, 
    # allowing you to categorize your posts.
    category = models.ForeignKey(Category, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    # __str__ method of the Post model represents the model instances as strings 
    # (e.g., when viewing them in the Django admin panel).
    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

To inject sample data in the model database through `admin panel` by `superuser`,

1. Ensure that you've registered the Post and Category model in the Django admin panel (`BlogApp/admin.py`).
   ```py
    from django.contrib import admin
    from .models import Post, Category

    admin.site.register(Post)
    admin.site.register(Category)
   ```
2. Add serialiers for Posts and Category in `BlogApp/serializers`,
   ```py
    from rest_framework import serializers # for simplifying model serialization.
    from .models import *

    ...

    class CategorySerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
        class Meta: 
            model = Category
            fields = "__all__"
            #include all fields from the respective model in the serialized output.
            
    class PostSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
        class Meta: 
            model = Post
            fields = "__all__"
    ...
   ```
